- 👋 Hi, I’m @CaileyCrandall


I'm a computational math student at the University of South Florida, concentrating on **Discrete Math** and **Cryptography**. I have a strong interest in **applied mathematics**, and I enjoy exploring how mathematical principles can be used to solve real-world problems.

My current focus includes **cryptography**, **coding theory**, and **math modeling**. I am always seeking opportunities to learn and grow, whether through internships, side projects, or collaborations.

### Things I Enjoy:
- **Rock climbing** 🧗‍♀️
- **Traveling** ✈️
- **Movies** 🎥 
- **Math** 📐
- **Skiing** 🏔️ 
Feel free to check out my repositories, where you’ll find my projects and contributions to various math and coding-related topics!
